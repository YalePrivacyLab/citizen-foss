## Citizen Four (2014):
Film following **Edward Snowden** as he shares NSA spy documents and attempts to flee Hong Kong. "Citizenfour" was one of Snowden's pseudonyms.

## FOSS (English, acronym):
Free and Open Source Software. "Open Source" is often a business term for **Free Software**. The "free" means "freedom" but, usually, it also costs nothing.
_Synonyms:_ Software libre, FLOSS.

<!-- *template: invert -->

> ...many people forget – maybe people haven’t seen _Citizen Four_, for example... but if you watch closely in credits, they thank a number of **FOSS** projects, including Debian, Tails, Tor, GnuPG, and so on and so forth.
>
> And that’s because what happened in 2013 **would not have been possible without Free Software**. I did not use Windows machines when I was in my operational phase because I couldn’t trust them.

## Snowden Documents<span style="float:right;">![50%](images/citizen-four.jpg)</span>
<!-- Screenshot from Citizenfour -->
#### Major takeaways:

==1.== **The Bad News:**
All popular communication services have been compromised by ==government and corporate surveillance==. <small>Mass data collection, software backdoors &amp; exploits, government information requests, data breaches.</small>

==2.== **The Good News:**
Snowden was able to communicate extremely sensitive information despite this, using a combination of [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and Operations Security ([OPSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security)) training.

<span style="float:right;">![48%](images/whatsapp-question.png)</span>
<!-- Person confused about security in corporate messengers -->
Some U.S. corporations now encrypt some communication, making ==mass surveillance== like [PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)) difficult.

* <small>Why trust these companies? 
Fool me twice, shame on me.</small>

* <small>On Facebook &amp; WhatsApp, your **metadata** and **social graph** are stored &amp; studied. WhatsApp may have a [spy backdoor](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/16/whatsapp-vulnerability-facebook).</small>

* <small>Apple knows **who** you talk to, even when they don't know **what** you say to them.</small>

This data can be used for ==targeted surveillance== by [police and intelligence agencies](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30593#efmAHtANd).

##### Establishing a trusted connection

Privacy tools require ==trust== and a ==shared secret==. That secret could be a username, a
URL, a passphrase, or an encryption key.

* <small>Share a secret using tools you learn about today.</small>

* <small>Meeting in person may be the best method.</small>

* <small>[Etherpads](https://pad.riseup.net/), pastebins/imagebins like [Up1](https://pad.riseup.net/), and
"burner" temporary e-mail accounts are good options.</small>

<small>Try to use ==Tor Browser== or ==Orfox== for first contact 
_(we'll cover this later)_.</small>

## Oﬀ The Record (==OTR==)
Text chat/IM is very safe, **if conﬁgured correctly.**

<small>**Jabber (XMPP)** is the basis for most IM (Google Chat etc.) but you need a trusted service provider. Try [DuckDuckGo XMPP](https://duck.co/blog/post/2/using-pidgin-with-xmpp-jabber), or join [Riseup](https://riseup.net/en/chat), [MayFirst](https://im.mayfirst.org/), or the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/associate/benefits).</small>

<small>Use **[Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/)** (Windows &amp; Linux) and **[Adium](https://adium.im/)** (Mac) with XMPP.
Check the settings and make sure you're not logging chats.</small>

<small>**Set up OTR** for truly private XMPP. [Follow this OTR guide](https://riseup.net/en/otr)</small>

**==Too complicated?==** Try [Ricochet](https://ricochet.im/) or [Tor Messenger](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-messenger-020b2-released).

* Favor [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and other [Free Software licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#SoftwareLicenses).

* Read the [EFF messaging scorecard](https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard), Wikipedia,
FOSS community reviews, &amp; online forums.

* Look for [warrant canaries](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/canary-watch-one-year-later) &amp; transparency reports.

* Browse [Tactical Tech](https://tacticaltech.org/) &amp; resources listed later.

We'll focus on [Firefox](https://getfirefox.com/) <small>([Iceweasel/IceCat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_software_rebranded_by_Debian#Iceweasel))</small>. 
Mozilla [values privacy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/principles/) &amp; has a [solid track record](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/history/).

<small>**Why not Google Chrome?** Most of the following tips will also work on Chrome &amp; [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) (100% FOSS version). Chrome contains **proprietary** code, has serious privacy issues, and reports back to Google several ways even if you try to opt out.</small>

<small>**Can I trust Chromium?** Maybe. Webcam/microphone [spyware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/23/google-eavesdropping-tool-installed-computers-without-permission) has been included with Chromium (not just Chrome) in the past, but it has since been removed. You will have to turn off the Google defaults and avoid Google services, however.</small>

**Tor is the standard for anonymity.**
<small>The Tor network thwarts the NSA's best efforts to
break it (we know this [thanks to Snowden](https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document)).</small>

* <small>**==However:==** Using Tor is not a magic bullet. Vulnerabilities may occur over time, so  **update often** (TBB will nag you!)</small>

* <small>**TBB Settings:** Go with the defaults. Customization makes you more susceptible  to [browser fingerprinting](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).</small>

* <small>**Bridges:** [Use if Tor is blocked](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#AddTorNotWorks) or you need extra protection.</small>

### Security Is ==Not Proprietary==
Recall [Richard Stallman's TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM).

* <small>Proprietary code is secret, often buggy and/or malicious.</small>

* <small>FOSS is a [basic requirement for security](https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1999/0915.html#OpenSourceandSecurity). Even then it requires "[many eyeballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law)".</small>

**Fortunately,** there is a lot of high-quality FOSS available, and many users, developers, &amp; security experts worldwide.

Let's concentrate on ==Android== variants, which are based upon GNU/Linux.

**Stock Android is insecure.** It has [dodgy](http://www.eweek.com/mobile/gooligans-malware-infects-more-than-1.3-million-devices-researchers-say.html) proprietary apps from ==Google==, the ==vendor== (e.g. Samsung), &amp; ==ISP== (e.g. AT&amp;T). It may have [backdoors for spies](http://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/what-you-need-to-know-about-phones-secretly-sending-data-china/).

**Some Android devices are  restrictive.** Your current device may not allow you to "free" it.  If so, ==keep freedom in mind== for your next device.

**iPhone/iPads are [restrictive](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/1256)**, with many pitfalls for security &amp; freedom. If you must use one, [jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking).

* **[Copperhead OS](https://copperhead.co/android/)** - Security is the priority. Only for Nexus phones. [Tor Prototype](https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/mission-improbable/) available.

* **[Lineage](http://lineageos.org/Yes-this-is-us/) or [OmniROM](https://omnirom.org/)** - Installs on many devices.

* **[XDA-Developers Forum](http://forum.xda-developers.com/)** - More alternatives.

## Got ==r00t==?
==rooting== a device means getting ==superuser== / ==sysadmin== access. It's a Unix-y term for [full control of a system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser). 

**With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility.**
Root ==**may**== be needed ==**temporarily**== to free your device. ROMs usually allow you to [turn it on and off](https://web.archive.org/web/20160522205137/http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/security-and-you).

**Unlocked Bootloader:** If this is a step in the [ROM installation process](https://web.archive.org/web/20161224205610/https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_angler#Unlocking_the_bootloader), you should lock it afterward.

**It's all part of the fun!** Back up your files, follow instructions, and use a "test device" if possible.

Expect large, consistent ==data breaches==.

**Major e-mail providers can't be trusted**.
<small>Even years after the Snowden disclosures, Yahoo! created [new NSA wiretaps](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/04/delete-your-yahoo-account/) and leaked [500 million accounts](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/technology/yahoo-hackers.html). Google [actively studies](https://www.scribd.com/document/171461409/Google-Gmail-Litigation) e-mails, even [spying as you type](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/technology/yahoo-hackers.html).</small>

### ==E-mail== is an easy target

* E-mail is often sent and received insecurely, yet users treat it as a secure channel.

* Inboxes are utilized for personal data storage.

* Weak passwords &amp; password sharing is common, especially under work pressure.

* Junk/spam filters play a [cat-and-mouse game](http://www.davidreiley.com/papers/SpamEconomics.pdf).

* [Phishing scams](https://theconversation.com/spearphishing-roiled-the-presidential-campaign-heres-how-to-protect-yourself-68274) are increasingly-sophisticated.

**Don't assume spies are too cool for phishing.** [Malware sent via e-mail](https://theintercept.com/document/2014/03/12/nsa-phishing-tactics-man-middle-attacks/) is a common tactic.

### The Road to Private ==Webmail==
###### Create a [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) account. Use ==Tor Browser== if you can.

* <small>**Pros:** Very easy to use, encrypts ==metadata== (subject, sender, recipient) as well as ==message content==. Android &amp; iOS [apps](https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/releases).</small>
* <small>**Cons:** Encryption only to other Tutanota addresses. Can't download your mail locally via ==POP== or ==IMAP==.</small>
* <small>[Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/) is a similar service, with encrypted, [password-protected e-mail](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/encrypt-for-outside-users/) to non-Protonmail users.</small>

* <small>**Pros:** The standard. Use almost any e-mail address. Easy [key sharing](http://www.pgp.net/pgpnet/pgp-faq/pgp-faq-keyservers.html). Multiple [trust models](http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/#p20). Allows for download.</small>
* <small>**Cons:** More complex to set up than webmail-only solutions. No privacy for metadata / e-mail headers / message subject.</small>

**Keep It Local:** Get your e-mail off of someone else's servers!
<small>Use ==POP== or ==IMAP== to download in a mail client like [Thunderbird/Icedove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_software_rebranded_by_Debian#Icedove).</small>

**E-mail Hosts:** Try [Riseup](https://user.riseup.net/forms/new_user/first) or [Mailfence](http://mailfence.com/), or [browse this list](http://www.emailquestions.com/encrypted-email-service-providers/).
<small>Mailfence has easy Gmail, Yahoo!, &amp; Office365 import, quick [PGP setup](https://www.mailfence.com/c/mailfence/more/crypto.jsp), and has [calendar / document sharing](https://blog.mailfence.com/secure-document-sharing/). Some features require paid account.</small>

## Avoid ==Web== Publishing Traps<span style="float:right;">![64%](images/evil-kermit.png)</span><!-- Evil Kermit meme -->

Sharing isn't just about conversations.
The Web is for publishing _World Wide_.

**Social networks** like Facebook are [walled gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform) with constant surveillance. Consider [federated social networks](https://prism-break.org/en/all/#social-networks).

Find trustworthy hosting for **[Websites](https://drupal.org), [Blogs](https://wordpress.org), &amp; [Wikis](https://mediawiki.org)**.  Big hosts like [WordPress.com](https://transparency.automattic.com/takedown-demands/) censor and take down websites.

* [MayFirst](https://mayfirst.org) is great for activists and has [defense from DDoS](https://deflect.ca/).

* [Whitelist Tor visitors](https://on1on.cf) if you use CloudFlare.

* Set up ==SSL/TLS== via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to protect your users.

* Don't force users into [ad networks](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/224601547-Ads-on-Medium) just to view &amp; comment.

**Remember:** [Etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net/) and [Up1](https://pad.riseup.net/) for quick copypasta.

#### Make a plan and stick to it.
* The <span style="color:#ffeeb5;">**What**</span>: Choose a few crypto, sharing, &amp; publishing tools.
* The <span style="color:#ffeeb5;">**How**</span>: Try these tools, figure out how they work.
* The <span style="color:#ffeeb5;">**Where**</span>: Find safe places to share secrets, on &amp; offline.
* The <span style="color:#ffeeb5;">**When**</span>: Describe scenarios when you will use each tool.
* The <span style="color:#ffeeb5;">**Why**</span>: State clear reasons to use each tool.
* The <span style="color:#ffeeb5;">**Who**</span>: Identify "experts" who can help &amp; teach others.

**The Only Constant Is Change!** Try new software, keep up on tech news &amp; potential threats, and re-evaluate over time.
